    {
      question: 'How quickly can you implement AI automation?',
      answer: 'We typically go from audit to pilot in 1-2 weeks, depending on your integrations and approval process. Most clients see results within the first month.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the AI makes a mistake?',
      answer: 'We build in multiple safety layers: human escalation rules, audit trails, and configurable limits. You always have oversight and can step in when needed.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do you handle sensitive data?',
      answer: 'We use least-privilege access, encrypted secrets, and can deploy on-premise or in your VPC. All data handling follows your existing security policies.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI integrate with our current tools?',
      answer: 'Yes, we connect to calendars, CRMs, phone systems, and more. We build custom integrations if needed, so you don\'t have to change your workflow.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What kind of support do you provide?',
      answer: '24/7 monitoring, regular check-ins, and dedicated support. We\'re here to ensure your AI employees work smoothly and improve over time.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do you measure success?',
      answer: 'We track real metrics: hours saved, response times, error reduction, and cost savings. You\'ll see exactly how much value the AI delivers.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if we need to make changes?',
      answer: 'We can update workflows, add new skills, or modify behavior without downtime. Your AI employees learn and adapt as your business evolves.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a long-term contract?',
      answer: 'No, we offer month-to-month plans. We\'re confident you\'ll see value quickly, but you\'re never locked in.'
